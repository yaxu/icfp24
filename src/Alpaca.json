		"abstract": "For centuries, scientists have struggled to understand the origins of the patterns and forms found in nature. Now, in this lucid and accessibly written book, Philip Ball applies state-of-the-art scientific understanding from the fields of biology, chemistry, geology, physics, and mathematics to these ancient mysteries, revealing how nature's seemingly complex patterns originate in simple physical laws. Tracing the history of scientific thought about natural patterns, Ball shows how common presumptions--for example, that complex form must be guided by some intelligence or that form always follows function--are erroneous and continue to mislead scientists today. He investigates specific patterns in depth, revealing that these designs are self-organized and that simple, local interactions between component parts produce motifs like spots, stripes, branches, and honeycombs. In the process, he examines the mysterious phenomenon of symmetry and why it appears--and breaks--in similar ways in different systems. Finally, he attempts to answer this profound question: why are some patterns universal? Illustrations throughout the text, many in full color, beautifully illuminate Ball's ideas.",

		"abstract": "Much of the initial use of digital technology within the printed textile industry has focused on the particular advantages that it has over previous fabric printing methods. Examples include simplifying workflow, producing relatively cheap short runs, or allowing designers to work with photographic imagery and unlimited colour palettes. This paper firstly identifies that digital fabric printing has a fundamentally different possibility in relation to its forerunners. Formerly, printing was essentially the ability to reproduce the same image (or text) over and over again. Digital printing, however, does not have to work from static information; it can print a design that changes as it is being printed.",

		"abstract": "This paper reports on two generative systems that work in the domain of textiles: the Hoopla system that generates patterns for embroidery samplers, and the Foundry system that creates foundation paper piecing patterns for quilts. Generated patterns are enacted and interpreted by the human who stitches the ﬁnal product, following a long and laborious, yet entertaining and leisurely, process of stitching and sewing. The blending of digital and physical spaces, the tension between machine and human authorship, and the juxtaposition of stereotypically masculine computing with highly feminine textile crafts, leads to the opportunity for new kinds of tools, experiences, and artworks. This paper argues for the values of textiles as a domain for generative methods research, and discusses generalizable research problems that are highlighted through operating in this new domain.",

By use of geometrical analysis, we trace changes of ornament and extract the underlying geometrical structure; we also use symmetry groups, the seven frieze groups and the seventeen wallpaper groups, in order to arrive at a deeper understanding of practical geometry in Sassanid stucco ornament. These analyses will evince features of Sassanid stucco ornament such as: motifs as part of the whole; rotational symmetry and repetition of motifs in linear networks; application of complicated geometrical structures with rotational or reflection symmetry; the planning of whole decorative panels. Also, analyzing the Sassanid stucco panels allows us to discover their repetitive units, which are then classified according to frieze and wallpaper groups.",

		"abstract": "Ethnocomputing is the study of the intersections between culture and computing. In addition to cultural analysis of computing, it also utilizes computing to model artifacts or practices from a given culture. In this essay, we consider three modes of modeling. In the first mode, the knowledge flow is unidirectional: the researcher analyzes indigenous designs and provides a computing model. In the second mode, the knowledge flow is bidirectional with researchers bringing a technical etic (outsider) perspective and informants bringing a cultural emic (insider) perspective. In the third mode, knowledge flow is recursive; there are bidirectional flows nested within other bidirectional flows. Our case study begins with computer simulations of log curves in Adinkra symbols in Ghana. Thus, we show that there are nested flows between nature and the indigenous artisans who model nature’s growth patterns; between our own ethnocomputing simulations and the students and teachers in Ghanaian classrooms; and finally between the history of computing in the West and the implementation of educational technology. Our data indicates that a recursive model that can account for these nested flows better enables researchers to integrate social justice and sustainability with education and research in both social and technical domains.\nKeywords: Agency; Ethnocomputing; Indigenous Design; Modeling; Translation.",

		"abstract": "Fractals are characterized by the repetition of similar patterns at ever-diminishing scales. Fractal geometry has emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers on the border between mathematics and information technology and can be seen in many of the swirling patterns produced by computer graphics. It has become a new tool for modeling in biology, geology, and other natural sciences. Anthropologists have observed that the patterns produced in different cultures can be characterized by specific design themes. In Europe and America, we often see cities laid out in a grid pattern of straight streets and right-angle corners. In contrast, traditional African settlements tend to use fractal structures-circles of circles of circular dwellings, rectangular walls enclosing ever-smaller rectangles, and streets in which broad avenues branch down to tiny footpaths with striking geometric repetition. These indigenous fractals are not limited to architecture; their recursive patterns echo throughout many disparate African designs and knowledge systems. Drawing on interviews with African designers, artists, and scientists, Ron Eglash investigates fractals in African architecture, traditional hairstyling, textiles, sculpture, painting, carving, metalwork, religion, games, practical craft, quantitative techniques, and symbolic systems. He also examines the political and social implications of the existence of African fractal geometry. His book makes a unique contribution to the study of mathematics, African culture, anthropology, and computer simulations.",

Building on advances in anthropological ideologies away from white cultural and intellectual supremacy, ethnomathematics acknowledges that mathematics is pervasive in everyone’s life and community, in terms of construction, trade, craftsmanship, and so on, practices that are historically, socially, and culturally embedded. Such activities rarely if ever involve the solution of quadratic equations, or computations such as 3/7 + 5/9, disembodied exercises that are so prominent in school mathematics, which thereby often alienates students. The needs of society for a cadre of people skilled in academic mathematics and its applications does not justify the collateral damage done by school mathematics in terms of unnecessarily cutting off educational and financial opportunities, and damage to intellectual and cultural identities.

Often associated with \"cultures without written expression\", it may also be defined as \"the mathematics which is practised among identifiable cultural groups\". It refers to a broad cluster of ideas ranging from distinct numerical and mathematical systems to multicultural mathematics education. The goal of ethnomathematics is to contribute both to the understanding of culture and the understanding of mathematics, and mainly to lead to an appreciation of the connections between the two.",

		"abstract": "This is the companion volume to the authors' groundbreaking Symmetries of Culture, the classic reference for symmetry analysis of pattern for anthropologists, archaeologists, art historians, mathematicians, and designers. Central to symmetry analysis is the use of symmetry in the more precise sense of its geometrical isometries in contrast to its everyday meaning of balance. For this volume, Donald Crowe and Dorothy Washburn invited colleagues from several disciplines to apply the method of symmetry analysis to actual case studies from cultures around the world.The essays compiled here explore how cultural information is embedded in the symmetrical structure of pattern. From descriptions of patterns on objects as diverse as Nasca embroideries, Ica Valley ceramics, Quechua textiles, Yombe mats, and Zulu beadwork, as well as from Amazonian shamanic therapy, ceramic design among the Shipibo, and Turkish Yörük weaving, the contributors reveal how the symmetrical structures in the patterns describe aspects of each culture's fundamental principles for living in the world. This approach offers a profoundly fresh way to read the meaning in pattern by arguing that pattern communicates through the structural metaphorsembedded in the symmetrical relationship of the pattern parts. The two volumes together offer readers a revolutionary new window into the communicative importance of design.",

		"abstract": "Gesture-typing is an efficient, easy-to-learn, and errortolerant technique for entering text on software keyboards. Our goal is to \"recycle\" users' otherwise-unused gesture variation to create rich output under the users' control, without sacrificing accuracy. Experiment 1 reveals a high level of existing gesture variation, even for accurate text, and shows that users can consciously vary their gestures under different conditions. We designed an Expressive Keyboard for a smart phone which maps input gesture features identified in Experiment 1 to a continuous output parameter space, i.e. RGB color. Experiment 2 shows that users can consciously modify their gestures, while retaining accuracy, to generate specific colors as they gesture-type. Users are more successful when they focus on output characteristics (such as red) rather than input characteristics (such as curviness). We designed an app with a dynamic font engine that continuously interpolates between several typefaces, as well as controlling weight and random variation. Experiment 3 shows that, in the context of a more ecologically-valid conversation task, users enjoy generating multiple forms of rich output. We conclude with suggestions for how the Expressive Keyboard approach can enhance a wide variety of gesture recognition applications.",

Placed firmly in a social and historical context, it shows that Shamanism, considered superstition by many today, is alive and well in Seoul in a rich tradition reaching back to the Chosôn Dynasty (1392-1910), the capital of which was Hanyang (now Seoul). The instruments, dress and other accoutrements of courtly life from the Chosôn Dynasty have been taken up, although transformed, in contemporary rituals among spirit-possessed Shamans. Through a comparison of Hanyang kut - the rituals of the Hanyang Shamans - and the ritual practice of Inner Asian Shamans, and through an analysis of the relations of spirit-possession music rituals to musok, the indigenous religion of Korea, Seo sheds light on the role of music, spiritual practice and culture in present-day Korea.",

We present slow technology: a design agenda for technology aimed at reflection and moments of mental rest rather than efficiency in performance. The aim of this paper is to develop a design philosophy for slow technology, to discuss general design principles and to revisit some basic issues in interaction design from a more philosophical point of view. We discuss examples of soniture and informative art as instances of slow technology and as examples of how the design principles can be applied in practice.",

First published in 1965, On Weaving bridges the transition between handcraft and the machine-made, highlighting the essential importance of material awareness and the creative leaps that can occur when design problems are tackled by hand.With her focus on materials and handlooms, Anni Albers discusses how technology and mass production place limits on creativity and problem solving, and makes the case for a renewed embrace of human ingenuity that is particularly important today. Her lucid and engaging prose is illustrated with a wealth of rare and extraordinary images showing the history of the medium, from hand-drawn diagrams and close-ups of pre-Columbian textiles to material studies with corn, paper, and the typewriter, as well as illuminating examples of her own work.Now available for a new generation of readers, this expanded edition of On Weaving updates the book’s original black-and-white illustrations with full-color photos, and features an afterword by Nicholas Fox Weber and essays by Manuel Cirauqui and T’ai Smith that shed critical light on Albers and her career.",

Timbrally distinct, asymmetrical in structure, and aurally prominent, time lines have drawn comment from scholars as keys to understanding African rhythm. This article focuses on the best known and most widely distributed of these, the so-called standard pattern, a seven-stroke figure spanning twelve eighth notes and disposed durationally as <2212221>. Observations about structure (including its internal dynamic, metrical potential, and rotational properties) are juxtaposed with a putative African-cultural understanding (inferred from the firm place of dance in the culture, patterns of verbal discourse, and a broad set of social values) in order to further illuminate the nature of African rhythm, foster dialogue between structural and cultural perspectives, and thereby contribute implicitly to the methodology of cross-cultural analysis.",

		"abstract": "Seeking new forms of expression in computer music, a small number of laptop composers are braving the challenges of coding music on the fly. Not content to submit meekly to the rigid interfaces of performance software like Ableton Live or Reason, they work with programming languages, building their own custom software, tweaking or writing the programs themselves as they perform. Often this activity takes place within some established language for computer music like SuperCollider, but there is no reason to stop errant minds pursuing their innovations in general scripting languages like Perl. This paper presents an introduction to the field of live coding, of real-time scripting during laptop music performance, and the improvisatory power and risks involved. We look at two test cases, the command-line music of slub utilising, amongst a grab-bag of technologies, Perl and REALbasic, and Julian Rohrhuber's Just In Time library for SuperCollider. We try to give a flavour of an exciting but hazardous world at the forefront of live laptop performance.",

		"abstract": "What does an ancient weaver know, when she knows how to weave? How is this complex knowledge graspable and representable? The article presents the research practice of the PENELOPE project as it sets to explore the distinctive logic and order of ancient weaving − an inferential dimension embedded in the material and thus mainly implicit, which is best grasped through performing and which we address here as microperformative. In archaic Greek literary and philosophical sources, weaving is cast as a technology capable of imposing order, creating complex structure, and providing a model for cosmic generation. This pre-scientific ‘knowledge through order’ that weaving affords is in turn embedded in a performance culture where notions like kosmos and poikilia refer to woven fabrics, performances of song-and-dance, patterns in nature and in craft. The production of textile patterns incorporates the organization of elements into wholes in a way that is logical and algorithmic yet still unsuited to be laid down in writing. The mode of knowing specific to weaving is a liminal notion at the intersection of technology, knowledge, and embodied practice. Labelling this mode of ordering as microperformativity, one implication is that reflective decision-making, non-propositional knowledge and material agency all have a bearing on how in weaving threads perform together with the algorithm employed by the weaver, who needs to make decisions on repeats and recursion to generate a coherent whole. Using self-made technology, we then attempt to convey through performances the elements included as separate acts in weaving on the warp-weighted loom of antiquity. The order and patterns of weaving circulate through a multimodal and multimedial performance where the rhythms of ancient Greek poetry, manipulated as musical pattern by the live coder, govern the choreography of a set of synchronized arachnoid robots plaiting a braid by dancing around a maypole.",

		"abstract": "In the 19th century, English textile workers responded to the introduction of new tecnologies on the factory floor by smashing them to bits. For years 'the Luddites' roamed the English countryside, practicing drills and maneuvers that they would later deploy on unassuming machines. The movement has been derided by scholars as a backwards-looking and ultimately ineffectual effort to stem the march of history; for Gavin Mueller, the movement gets at the heart of of the antagonistic relationship between workers - all workers, including us today - and the so-called progressive gains secured by new technologies. The luddites weren't primitive or even anachronistic - they are still a force, however unconsciously, in the workplaces of the 21st century world. Breaking Things at Work is an innovative rethinking of labor and machines, leaping from textile mills to algorithms, from existentially threatened knife cutters of rural Germany to surveillance evading truckers driving across the continental United States. Mueller argues that the future stability and empowerment of working class movements will depend on subverting these technologies and preventing their spread wherever possible. The task is high, but the seeds of this resistance are already present in the Neo-Luddite efforts of hackers, pirates, and dark web users who are challenging surveillance and control, often through older systems of communication technology.",

		"abstract": "This chapter examines a performance devised and developed collaboratively by the authors between 2007 -11 which uses a repetitious, machine-inspired nineteenth-century dance to control a digital arts piece, exploring the performative interface between human machine workers and technology. The performance was awarded a Quake contemporary dance festival award in 2008. The dance, the The Machinery, traceable to the1820s, is striking as possibly the earliest example of the creative expression of alienation and dehumanization in the industrial workspace. Nineteenth-century cotton mill workers surrendered to the pace of the machine through necessity; in The Machinery, workers find a means of expression by coalescing with the machine, rather than escaping it, reflecting De Certeau's theories of ?the everyday?. A means of addressing boredom and repetition, the predominantly female workers responded performatively to the otherwise potentially overpowering and isolating noises and actions of ?the uniform and unceasing motion of the automaton? (Marx). The dance can be viewed as a way of maintaining the body's control, interaction and creativity, rather than allowing the body to become solely an extension of the capitalist means of production. Paralleling the working conditions of the nineteenth-century textile workers with those of today's computer operators, Radcliffe and Angliss created a mixed media performance piece inspired by women's interaction with technology. Taking the steps of the early nineteenth-century clog dance, they re-contextualised its history, using it to control a machine of the twenty-first century, the digital computer. Thus, the performers - dancer and computer operator - work together to create an intermedial space where the real world, occupied by the human worker, and virtual world of the machine are coupled to each other and acting in equal partnership. The extreme, machine-like control, virtuosity and physical endurance of the dance reflect the stamina required to survive repetitive labour in both the industrial and the post-industrial workplace.",

The role of pattern in uniting dance, music and language is investigated in the ancient practice of weaving, in ancient Greek choral lyric, and contemporary live coding. In this context the TidalCycles environment is introduced, with some visual and audio examples. Cyclic metrical patterns in ancient Greek are then explored in detail, particularly the metrical transformations of Epiplokē. Finally, this jump between contemporary and ancient practice leads us to consider algorave itself as a Luddite movement, its proponents engaged in an unravelling of technology.",

		"abstract": "Computational handweaving combines the repeatable precision of digital fabrication with relatively high production demands of the user: a weaver must be physically engaged with the system to enact a pattern, line by line, into a fabric. Rather than approaching co-presence and repetitive labor as a negative aspect of design, we look to current practices in procedural generation (most commonly used in game design and screen-based new media art) to understand how designers can create room for suprise and emergent phenomena within systems of precision and constraint. We developed three designs for blending real-time input with predetermined pattern features. These include: using camera imagery sampled at weaving time; a 1:1 scale tool for composing patterns on the loom; and a live \"Twitch'' stream where spectators determine the woven pattern. We discuss how experiential qualities of the systems led to different balances of underdetermination in procedural generation as well as how such an approach might help us think beyond an artifact/experience dichotomy in fabrication.",

In this book, pioneering computer scientist Seymour Papert uses the invention of LOGO, the first child-friendly programming language, to make the case for the value of teaching children with computers. Papert argues that children are more than capable of mastering computers, and that teaching computational processes like de-bugging in the classroom can change the way we learn everything else. He also shows that schools saturated with technology can actually improve socialization and interaction among students and between students and teachers.Technology changes every day, but the basic ways that computers can help us learn remain. For thousands of teachers and parents who have sought creative ways to help children learn with computers, Mindstorms is their bible.",

Pat Treusch not only shows how both the fields of technofeminism and robotics can engage in a practical exchange through knitting, but also contributes a tangible example of coboting dynamics. Robotic Knitting re-negotiates the boundaries between formalization and embodiment, craft and high-tech as well as useful and dysfunctional machines. It re-crafts the nature of collaboration between human and robot. This finally entails an alternative mode of relating – a mode that enables an account of careful coboting.",

		"abstract": "The philosopher Daniel Dennett argues that complex structures in the natural and cultural worlds emerge from two types of design. Bottom-up design involves the rote action of a simple algorithm in an environment constrained by physical laws. Top-down design involves deliberation and planning, and is unique to modern humans. Identifying the emergence of top-down design in the hominin lineage is an important research challenge, and the archaeological record of stone technology is our best evidence for it. A current view is that artefact types and flaking methods increased in complexity from 3.3 to c. 0.3 million years ago, reflecting improving capacities at spatial cognition and working memory, culminating in top-down design perhaps as early as 1.75 million years ago. Recent experimental work, however, has shown that a simple ‘remove flake’ algorithm constrained by the laws of fracture mechanics—a form of bottom-up design—can produce stone tool attributes thought to be evidence of top-down design. Here, these models are reviewed and critiqued in light of the new experimental evidence. A revised working memory-based model, focusing on the recursive aspects of stone flaking, is proposed.",

In the last few hundred years, we have stopped training our memories and we have lost the ability to memorise large amounts of information.      Memory Craft   introduces the best memory techniques humans have ever devised, from ancient times and the Middle Ages, to methods used by today's memory athletes. Lynne Kelly has tested all these methods in experiments which demonstrate the extraordinary capacity of our brains at any age.    For anyone who needs to memorise a speech or a play script, learn anatomy or a foreign language, or prepare for an exam,   Memory Craft   is a fabulous toolkit. It offers proven techniques for teachers to help their students learn more effectively. There are also simple strategies for anyone who has trouble remembering names or dates, and for older people who want to keep their minds agile. Above all, memorising things can be playful, creative and great fun.",

Devising ways to address additional phases may be critical, because research shows that over one-half of the programs written by end users, at least in the widely used spreadsheet paradigm, contain errors. In this paper, we investigate whether providing end users with integrated support for requirement specifications in the form of assertions can help them reason about, recognize, and remove errors in their spreadsheets. Our think-aloud study revealed that end users can indeed use assertions to find and correct errors as they work with their spreadsheets, and also revealed some surprising tendencies and biases about testing.",

		"abstract": "The TidalCycles (or Tidal for short) live coding environment has been developed since around 2009, via several rewrites of its core representation. Rather than having fixed goals, this development has been guided by use, motivated by the open aim to make music. This development process can be seen as a long-form improvisation, with insights into the nature of Tidal gained through the process of writing it, feeding back to guide the next steps of development. This brings the worrying thought that key insights will have been missed along this development journey, that would otherwise have lead to very different software. Indeed participants at beginners’ workshops that I have lead or co-lead have often asked questions without good answers, because they made deficiencies or missing features in the software clear. It is well known that a beginner’s mind is able to see much that an expert has become blind to. Running workshops are an excellent way to find new development ideas, but the present paper explores a different technique - the rewrite.",

The key ideas in Fran are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are sets of arbitrarily complex conditions, carrying possibly rich information. Most traditional values can be treated as behaviors, and when images are thus treated, they become animations. Although these notions are captured as data types rather than a programming language, we provide them with a denotational semantics, including a proper treatment of real time, to guide reasoning and implementation. A method to effectively and efficiently perform event detection using interval analysis is also described, which relies on the partial information structure on the domain of event times. Fran has been implemented in Hugs, yielding surprisingly good performance for an interpreter-based system. Several examples are given, including the ability to describe physical phenomena involving gravity, springs, velocity, acceleration, etc. using ordinary differential equations.",

First, the writing of musical patterns in live coding performance, and second, the weaving of patterns in textiles. In both cases, algorithmic pattern is an interface between the human and the outcome, where small changes have far-reaching impact on the results. By bringing contemporary live coding and ancient textile approaches together, we reach a common view of pattern as algorithmic movement (e.g. looping, shifting, reflecting, interfering) in the making of things. This works beyond the usual definition of pattern used in musical interfaces, of mere repeating sequences. We conclude by considering the place of algorithmic pattern in a wider activity of making.",

Yet, while valuable research material on gamelan music is available, this is the only short book available for non-Southeast Asians coming into contact with gamelan for the first time. The book outlines some of the basic concepts of Javanese gamelan, and provides a listening framework so that the exotic sounds can be given musical and cultural sense. Included in the text is an explanation of the historical background, the instruments and their making, tuning and notation, the structure of the music, and the place of gamelan music in Javanese society. For those who are traveling in Java, there is a list of places to go to hear gamelan music, and for those who are interested in further study, there is a list of suggested reading and recordings.",

These issues include attitudes, curriculum development, educational change, academic achievement, standardized and other tests, performance factors, student characteristics, cross-cultural differences and studies, literacy, native speakers, social class and differences, equal education, teaching methods, knowledge level, educational guidelines and policies, transitional schools, comparative education, other subjects such as physics and social studies, surveys, talent, educational research, teacher education and qualifications, academic standards, teacher effectiveness, lesson plans and modules, teacher characteristics, instructional materials, program effectiveness, program evaluation, African culture, African history, Black studies, class activities, educational games, number systems, cognitive ability, foreign influence, and fundamental concepts. What unifies the chapters in this book can appear rather banal, but many mathematical insights are so obvious and so fundamental that they are difficult to absorb, appreciate, and express with fresh clarity. Some of the more basic insights are isolated by accounts of investigators who have earned their contemporaries' respect. Winner of the 2012 Cecil B. Currey Book Award.",

This paper presents the materials, steps and shape rules that begin to synthesize the craft, as well as one design.

The discussion culminates in a proposal for a new human science that challenges the current dogma of the \"two cultures\" of sciences and humanities.",

The Gibber environment en-ables simple networked performances where multiple users simultaneously control a remote instance of Gibber. We strove to make the syntax of Gibber clear and concise; when coupled with the ability to run examples in any web page this gives Gibber interesting possibilities as an edu-cational tool. 1.",

The Tacit Dimension argues that tacit knowledge—tradition, inherited practices, implied values, and prejudgments—is a crucial part of scientific knowledge. Back in print for a new generation of students and scholars, this volume challenges the assumption that skepticism, rather than established belief, lies at the heart of scientific discovery. “Polanyi’s work deserves serious attention. . . . [This is a] compact presentation of some of the essentials of his thought.”—Review of Metaphysics “Polanyi’s work is still relevant today and a closer examination of this theory that all knowledge has personal and tacit elements . . . can be used to support and refute a variety of widely held approaches to knowledge management.”—Electronic Journal of Knowledge \"The reissuing of this remarkable book give us a new opportunity to see how far-reaching—and foundational—Michael Polanyi's ideas are, on some of the age-old questions in philosophy.\"—Amartya Sen, from the new Foreword",

		"abstract": "Introduction‘Live coding’ has become a performative artistic practice that lies at the intersection of programming and artistic creation, often with an emphasis on music. Typically, live coding performances are presented on a stage, upon which there is a (personal) computer and a human producing code in one of a number of programming languages in real time. The screen of the performer is usually projected so that the audience can see the edits of code being produced. Sometimes, this code may be interpretable by the audience:sound “kick kick clap kick”As part of this, the audience thus witnesses the computer following the code/instructions, such as by producing an audio signal; in the example above, a musical pattern of three kick drums and a classic handclap sample. The visual cue provided by the code is important. Since the audience see on the screen that the clap falls on the third beat, they may try to adjust their cognition to ‘perceive’ the clap as the third beat of a 4/4 bar.As our performance continues, with this programme running in a loop, the performer edits the code:sound “kick kick clap*2 kick?”Now the audience hears two kicks and two faster claps, sometimes followed by a rest and at other times by a kick (the ‘sometimes’ induced by the inclusion of the ‘?’). The performer keeps editing the code and the music continues to change until either the computer crashes; the programme fails; the performer gets lost in the code; or the prescribed performance duration is over.Live coding is therefore the practice of writing and manipulating algorithms by programming (writing code) in front of an audience, and thereby exposing that audience to the effects of the code, which usually (but not always) takes the form of an audio-visual output: music, sound art, visuals, poetry, or dance, for example. Live coding is neither a form nor style of music; it is an audio-visual practice that draws extensively on many forms and styles of music. Live coding is also a thought-experiment with various side-effects, some of which can be framed as music.",

		"abstract": "This paper introduces Strudel (or sometimes StrudelCycles), an alternative implementation of the Tidal (or Tidal-Cycles) live coding system, using the JavaScript programming language. Strudel is an attempt to make live coding more accessible, by creating a system that runs entirely in the browser, while opening Tidals approach to algorithmic patterns (Mclean 2020) up to modern audio/visual web technologies. The Strudel REPL is a live code editor dedicated to manipulating Strudel patterns while they play, with builtin visual feedback. While Strudel is written in JavaScript, the API is optimized for simplicity and readability by applying code transformations on the syntax tree level, allowing language operations that would otherwise be impossible. The application supports multiple ways to output sound, including Tone.js, Web Audio nodes, OSC (Open Sound Control) messages, Web Serial andWeb MIDI. The project is split into multiple packages, allowing granular reuse in other applications. Apart from TidalCycles, Strudel draws inspiration from many prior existing projects like TidalVortex (McLean et al. 2022), Gibber (Roberts and Kuchera-morin 2012), Estuary (Ogborn et al. 2017), Hydra (Jack [2022] 2022), Ocarina (Solomon [2021] 2022) and Feedforward (McLean 2020).",

Where did these devices come from, whose labor created them, and what social and cultural forces collided to make their creation and adoption possible?

		"abstract": "A variety of short time delays inserted between pairs of subjects were found to affect their ability to synchronize a musical task. The subjects performed a clapping rhythm together from separate sound-isolated rooms via headphones and without visual contact. One-way time delays between pairs were manipulated electronically in the range of 3 to 78 ms. We are interested in quantifying the envelope of time delay within which two individuals produce synchronous performances. The results indicate that there are distinct regimes of mutually coupled behavior, and that `natural time delay'ödelay within the narrow range associated with travel times across spatial arrangements of groups and ensembles ösupports the most stable performance. Conditions outside of this envelope, with time delays both below and above it, create characteristic interaction dynamics in the mutually coupled actions of the duo. Trials at extremely short delays (corresponding to unnaturally close proximity) had a tendency to accelerate from anticipation. Synchronization lagged at longer delays (larger than usual physical distances) and produced an increasingly severe deceleration and then deterioration of performed rhythms. The study has implications for music collaboration over the Internet and suggests that stable rhythmic performance can be achieved by `wired ensembles' across distances of thousands of kilometers.",

		"abstract": "This research is a practice-led investigation into collaborative user interfaces within the practice of live coding; the act of writing computer code for generating improvised music live in front of an audience. It examines the impact of user interface design parameters on group creativity and explores the roles of data, text, and programming languages as media for musical communication. Utilising a multi-faceted research method that combines iterative “participatory design” (Spinuzzi, 2005) with performance-led “research in the wild” (Benford et al., 2013), this research couples ethnographic and autoethnographic observations to gain insight into the practice of ensemble live coding and inform software design. Three novel collaborative interfaces have been developed as part of this research that explore various facets of musical collaboration in live coding. Each interface was developed through an iterative and reflexive methodology focused on user-centred design and was employed in a cyclical process of artistic practice and refinement based on user evaluation and in-depth study. The first interface, entitled Troop, is a shared text editor that allows multiple performers to collaborate on the same single body of code together. The second, CodeBank, explores how private working in a collaborative context affects creativity and improvisation. Finally, PolyGlot, combines multiple live coding languages into a single collaborative interface that enables live coding musicians to play together, regardless of their knowledge of languages. As well as these three graphical interfaces, the functionality of an existing live coding language, FoxDot, was extended to help facilitate the sharing of musical information within an ensemble. Each interface was used in live performance by The Yorkshire Programming Ensemble and evaluated through group interview sessions that examined the themes of immediacy, trust, and risk with regards to both human-computer interaction and intra-ensemble communication as well as the experience of personal- and group-flow states.",

In the perception condition, the part was presented before the complete pattern, but in the imagery condition, the part was presented after the complete pattern. Subjects made fast, but inaccurate, responses in the perception task when RT s were recorded, but the error rate declined substantially when they were given 10 sec to make a decision. In the latter condition, subjects failed to detect a part on 14% of the trials in the perception condition and on 72% of the trials in the imagery condition when a correction was made for prior perception of the part. A subsequent experiment showed that the high error rate in the imagery task was not the result of the subject’s inability to remember the complete pattern. The complexity of mental operations and the limited accuracy of visual images are considered as possible alternative explanations of the results.",

		"abstract": "This highly illustrated book draws together the wide variety of studies in the learning of mathematics undertaken by the Pattern in Mathematics Research Group at the University of Leeds. Their purpose has been '... to provide structure and support to ... studies of children's perception, conception and use of pattern in learning mathematics'. Set up in 1992, they have embraced work across the whole curriculum, and through all the years of compulsory schooling.As each chapter of this book relates to a different study that was undertaken, the reader can dip in and select relevant material. At the same time, the editor has ensured continuity and progression, allowing the book to be approached as a whole: the early chapters are concerned with very young children; subsequent chapters deal with the primary and middle age ranges, and later ones relate to secondary school work.With individual chapters relating to number, algebra, shape, graphic relations and probability, this new volume provides guidance for teachers of pupils of all age groups.Patterns in mathematics are of immense importance; this book relates pattern to the teaching of mathematics through all years of school. Practical and original, it is closely tied to the National Curriculum. It is a source of new ideas for mathematic teachers at all levels.",

This book is organized into five parts encompassing 11 chapters that particularly focus on visual pattern recognition and the many issues relevant to a more general theory of pattern recognition.The first three parts cover the representation, temporal effects, and memory codes of pattern recognition. These parts include the features, templates, schemata, and structural descriptions of information processing models. The principles of parallel matching, iconic storage, and the components and networks of memory codes are also considered. The remaining two parts look into the perceptual classification and response selection of pattern recognition. These parts specifically tackle the development of probability, distance, and recognition models.This book is intended primarily for psychologists, graduate students, and researchers who are interested in the problems of pattern recognition and human information processing.",

The recognition ratings of the 8-year-olds and of the adults indicated that they had abstracted a prototypical stimulus pattern reflecting all of the acquisition stimulus patterns. The 6-year-olds seem to have abstracted only a part of the prototypical stimulus pattern.

		"abstract": "A scheme is proposed that relates the internal representation of pattern stimuli to visual pattern discrimination performance. The main assumptions of the scheme are: (1) internal representations are assigned to patterns probabilistically; (2) internal representations are discrete; (3) visual discriminability of two patterns is determined by the differences in the assignment probabilities of their internal representations. It is suggested that the internal representations associated with a pattern may be analyzed by measuring the visual detectability of small changes in pattern shape at points along a continuum of shapes. This continuum is generated by a group of transformations smoothly parameterized by a single variable. In two experiments designed to test this approach, subjects discriminated pattern displays containing combinations of three-dot subpatterns. Under the hypothesis that there were just two relevant internal representations, specifying dot collinearity and dot noncollinearity, the qualitative characteristics of the discrimination performance were correctly predicted.",

		"abstract": "Representation of the visual and spatial properties of our environment is a pivotal requirement of everyday cognition. We can mentally represent the visual form of objects. We can extract information from several of the senses as to the location of objects in relation to ourselves and to other objects nearby. For some of those objects we can reach out and manipulate them. We can also imagine ourselves manipulating objects in advance of doing so, or even when it would be impossible to do so physically. The problem posed to science is how these cognitive operations are accomplished, and proffered accounts lie in two essentially parallel research endeavours, working memory and imagery. Working memory is thought to pervade everyday cognition, to provide on-line processing and temporary storage, and to update, moment to moment, our representation of the current state of our environment and our interactions with that environment. There is now a strong case for the claims of working memory in the area of phonological and articulatory functions, all of which appear to contribute to everyday activities such as counting, arithmetic, vocabulary acquisition, and some aspects of reading and language comprehension. The claims for visual and spatial working memory functions are less convincing. Most notable has been the assumption that visual and spatial working memory are intimately involved in the generation, retention and manipulations of visual images. There has until recently been little hard evidence to justify that assumption, and the research on visual and spatial working memory has focused on a relatively restricted range of imagery tasks and phenomena. In a more or less independent development, the literature on visual imagery has now amassed a voluminous corpus of data and theory about a wide range of imagery phenomena. Despite this, few books on imagery refer to the concept of working memory in any detail, or specify the nature of the working memory system that might be involved in mental imagery. This essay follows a line of reconciliation and positive critiquing in exploring the possible overlap between mental imagery and working memory. Theoretical development in the book draws on data from both cognitive psychology and cognitive neuropsychology. The aim is to stimulate debate, to address directly a number of assumptions that hitherto have been implicit, and to assess the contribution of the concept of working memory to our understanding of these intriguing core aspects of human cognition.",

		"abstract": "The effectiveness of mental imagery with and without drawing support (perceptual assistance) in the visual synthesis of novel patterns was studied in three experiments. When the task was to create one recognizable pattern from three simple shapes in a 2-min assembly period, subjects were as likely to produce a recognizable or creative pattern per trial whether mental imagery was augmented by external drawing support or not. When the task was to create as many patterns as possible in a 3-min assembly period, more patterns were produced per trial with external drawing support than without; however, neither the recognizability nor the creativity of the patterns differed. Differences in performance in the visual synthesis task with and without external drawing support are interpreted in terms of limited cognitive resources.",

Although we take our ability to perform tasks such as these for granted, they raise a host of interesting questions about imagery. For instance, what is the relationship between imagery and perception? What types of processes are needed to account for our ability to generate, maintain, transform, and inspect images? How do we characterize individual differences in imagery ability? What is the relation between imagery and spatial representation? What can we do with mental imagery? This essay will focus on visual imagery, because we know more about visual imagery than auditory, haptic, gustatory, or olfactory imagery. The expectation is that many principles, although not all details, of emerging theory will be applicable to imagery in other modes.",

		"abstract": "Subjects either viewed or visualized arrays that were divided into four quadrants, with each quadrant containing a set of stripes. In two experiments, one array contained only relatively narrow (highresolution) stripes, and one contained only relatively thick (low-resolution) stripes. The subjects compared sets of stripes in different quadrants according to their length, spacing, orientation, or width. When the subjects visualized the arrays, they required much more time to compare high-resolution patterns than low-resolution patterns; when the subjects saw the arrays, they evaluated both types of arrays equally easily. In addition, the results from the third experiment provide strong evidence that people use imagery in this task; in one condition, the subjects evaluated oblique sets of stripes, and in another condition, they evaluated vertical and horizontal stripes. In both imagery and perception, the subjects made more errors when evaluating oblique stimuli; in imagery, they also required more time to evaluate oblique stimuli. The results suggest that additional effort is required in imagery to represent visual patterns with high resolution. This finding demonstrates that, although imagery and perception may activate common brain regions, it is more difficult to represent high-resolution information in imagery than in perception.",

		"abstract": "Visual working memory provides an essential link between past and future events. Despite recent efforts, capacity limits, their genesis and the underlying neural structures of visual working memory remain unclear. Here we show that performance in visual working memory - but not iconic visual memory - can be predicted by the strength of mental imagery as assessed with binocular rivalry in a given individual. In addition, for individuals with strong imagery, modulating the background luminance diminished performance on visual working memory and imagery tasks, but not working memory for number strings. This suggests that luminance signals were disrupting sensory-based imagery mechanisms and not a general working memory system. Individuals with poor imagery still performed above chance in the visual working memory task, but their performance was not affected by the background luminance, suggesting a dichotomy in strategies for visual working memory: individuals with strong mental imagery rely on sensory-based imagery to support mnemonic performance, while those with poor imagery rely on different strategies. These findings could help reconcile current controversy regarding the mechanism and location of visual mnemonic storage.",

Here we show that the content and strength of future voluntary imagery can be decoded from activity patterns in visual and frontal areas well before participants engage in voluntary imagery. Participants freely chose which of two images to imagine. Using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and multi-voxel pattern analysis, we decoded imagery content as far as 11 seconds before the voluntary decision, in visual, frontal and subcortical areas. Decoding in visual areas in addition to perception-imagery generalization suggested that predictive patterns correspond to visual representations. Importantly, activity patterns in the primary visual cortex (V1) from before the decision, predicted future imagery vividness. Our results suggest that the contents and strength of mental imagery are influenced by sensory-like neural representations that emerge spontaneously before volition.",

		"abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to eliminate millions of jobs, from finance to truck driving. But artisanal products—(e.g. handmade textiles) are valued precisely because of their human origins, and thus have some inherent “immunity” from AI job loss. At the same time, artisanal labor, combined with technology, could potentially help to democratize the economy, allowing independent, small scale businesses to flourish. Could AI, robotics and related automation technologies enhance the economic viability and environmental sustainability of these beloved crafting professions, perhaps even expanding their niche to replace some job loss in other sectors? In this paper we compare the problems created by the current mass production economy, and potential solutions from an artisanal economy. In doing so, the paper details the possibilities of utilizing AI to support hybrid forms of human-machine production at the micro-scale; localized and sustainable value chains at the meso-scale; and networks of these localized and sustainable producers at the macro scale. In short, a wide range of automation technologies are potentially available for facilitating and empowering an artisanal economy. Ultimately, it is our hope that this paper will facilitate a discussion on a future vision for more “generative” economic forms in which labor value, ecological value and social value can circulate without extraction or alienation.",

		"abstract": "We present a methodology that enables dance tempo estimation through the acquisition of 3D accelerometer signals using a single wearable inertial device positioned on the dancer’s leg. Our tempo estimation method is based on enhanced multiple resonators, implemented with comb feedback filters. To validate the methodology, we focus on the versatile solo jazz dance style. Including a variety of dance moves, with different leg activation patterns and rhythmical variations, solo jazz provides for a highly critical validation environment. We consider 15 different solo jazz dance moves, with different leg activation patterns, assembled in a sequence of 5 repetitions of each, giving 65 moves altogether. A professional and a recreational dancer performed this assembly in a controlled environment, following eight dancing tempos, dictated by a metronome, and ranging from 80 bpm to 220 bpm with 20 bpm increment steps. We show that with appropriate enhancements and using single leg signals, the comb filter bank provides for accurate dance tempo estimates for all moves and rhythmical variations considered. Dance tempo estimates for the overall assembles match strongly the dictated tempo—the difference being at most 1 bpm for all measurement instances is within the limits of the established beat onset stability of the used metronome. Results further show that this accuracy is achievable for shorter dancing excerpts, comprising four dance moves, corresponding to one music phrase, and as such enables real-time feedback. By providing for a dancer’s tempo quality and consistency assessment, the presented methodology has the potential of supporting the learning process, classifying individual level of experience, and assessing overall performance. It is extendable to other dance styles and sport motion in general where cyclical patterns occur.",

		"abstract": "Over the last decade, more and more data are collected and opened. Governments actively stimulate the opening of data to increase citizen engagement to support policy-making processes. Evidence-based policy-making is the situation whereby decisions made are based on factual data. The common expectation is that releasing data will result in evidence-based decision-making and more trust in government decisions. This study aims to provide insight into how evidence-based policy based on open data can result into uncertainty and even polarize the policy-making process. We analyze a case study in which traffic and road utilization datasets are used and model the decision-making process using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). The BPMN model shows how the government and business organizations can use the data and give different interpretations. Data-driven decision-making might potentially create uncertainty, polarization, and less trust in decisions as stakeholders can give different meanings to the data and arrive at different outcomes. In contrast to the common belief, we found that the more data released, the more discussions happened about what is desired according to the data. The various directions derived from the data can even polarize decision-making. In other words, the more data opened, the more people can construct their perception of reality. For further research, we recommend understanding the types and role of data to create an evidence-based approach.",

In the face of concerns about high-tech pollution, increasingly empowered labor organizations, and a newly politicized and visible American Indian civil rights movement, indigenous electronic workers at Shiprock were pressed into service as examples of the peaceful coexistence and integration of the past and the future, the primitive and the modern, creativity and capitalism. Navajo women workers were described as ideal predigital digital workers, uniquely suited to the job by temperament, culture, and gender. Their labor as platform builders was cited as evidence that digital work—the work of the hand and its digits—could be painlessly transferred from the indigenous cultural context into the world of technological commercial innovation, benefiting both in the process.",

Through algorithms, Algorave members have discovered the power of altering music’s structure. In the face of a fully automated future, this article queries whether this power may be directed towards defying political, economic, ideological, or ethical systems. First, I present Algorave as an idiosyncratic environment of a post-work society. Second, I develop a critique of Kathi Weeks’ handling of the concept of subjectivity to question a post-work imaginary that comprises the subject. Third, I explain the pertinence of a critical subjectivity praxis for Algorave to enrich their post-work stance, whereby I suggest using their analytical lens on algorithms to prevent subjectivity from passing on to the post-human terrain. From here, I conclude that the subject of automation is the automated subject, and that a post-work society is not possible without overthrowing subjectivity. I ultimately caution the advocates of automation when pursuing post-work, for if automation manages to make subjectivity a part of algorithms with governmental impact, we will be—now and for good—automatically condemned to living as subjects, significantly reinforcing the basis of neoliberal work.",

Our research team has been working on the construction of a common morphokinetic alphabet (CMA) for the systematic observation of daily life activities. The project, which was launched several years ago, was designed to create a system for describing and analyzing body motion expression, physical activity, and physical appearance. In this paper, we describe an idiosyncratic application of Noam Chomsky’s phrase marker grammar to the morphokinetic phrase, the objective being to establish the grammatical rules and basic order of the symbol string according to a relational tree formed by the breakdown of the syntactic components identified as structuring the visual description of movement. Criteria for using the CMA as a coding system and a free transcription system are proposed.",

A few examples display clearly some salient features of the habits of exposition and the methods of thought of ancient and medieval Indian mathematicians. The attitude of the traditional learned man, called “pandit”, is the same, whether he works on literary or technical matter. Propensity to orality, use of memory, brain work are his specific qualities. Composition in verse form, use of synonymous words, metaphorical expression, which are unexpected processes for the exposition of technical matter, have been the rule in all the vast Sanskrit mathematical literature. The present article analyses a technique of memorization of the text of the Vedas, the earliest exposition of geometry rules in the context of Vedic rites of building brick altars, the numeration system, the arithmetical and geometrical concept of square.",

Scholars and archaeologists have told us that slings like the one David employed were common in the Old World, used not just for shepherd boys to kill giants but for protecting herds, hunting, and combat. However, few scholars have addressed the function slings have occupied outside of Eurasian civilizations, especially their use in Oceania and the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this astounding new archaeological survey, authors Robert York and Gigi York examine the history of Oceania and the Americas to unveil the significant role slings and slingstones played in developing societies. They present new evidence that suggests that unlike David who plucked rounded pebbles from a stream, inhabitants of the Pacific Islands deliberately fashioned sling missiles out of coral, stone, and clay into uniquely deadly shapes. They also show that the use of slings in the Americas was more pervasive and inclined to variability than previously recognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well documented, bountifully illustrated, and thoroughly researched, &lt;i&gt;Slings and Slingstones&lt;/i&gt; is sure to engage readers interested in expanding their knowledge of the past.

		"abstract": "This is the companion volume to the authors' groundbreaking Symmetries of Culture, the classic reference for symmetry analysis of pattern for anthropologists, archaeologists, art historians, mathematicians, and designers. Central to symmetry analysis is the use of symmetry in the more precise sense of its geometrical isometries in contrast to its everyday meaning of balance. For this volume, Donald Crowe and Dorothy Washburn invited colleagues from several disciplines to apply the method of symmetry analysis to actual case studies from cultures around the world.The essays compiled here explore how cultural information is embedded in the symmetrical structure of pattern. From descriptions of patterns on objects as diverse as Nasca embroideries, Ica Valley ceramics, Quechua textiles, Yombe mats, and Zulu beadwork, as well as from Amazonian shamanic therapy, ceramic design among the Shipibo, and Turkish Yörük weaving, the contributors reveal how the symmetrical structures in the patterns describe aspects of each culture’s fundamental principles for living in the world. This approach offers a profoundly fresh way to read the meaning in pattern by arguing that pattern communicates through the structural metaphors embedded in the symmetrical relationship of the pattern parts. The two volumes together offer readers a revolutionary new window into the communicative importance of design.",

Yet, while valuable research material on gamelan music is available, this is the only short book available for non-Southeast Asians coming into contact with gamelan for the first time. The book outlines some of the basic concepts of Javanese gamelan, and provides a listening framework so that the exotic sounds can be given musical and cultural sense. Included in the text is an explanation of the historical background, the instruments and their making, tuning and notation, the structure of the music, and the place of gamelan music in Javanese society.

By use of geometrical analysis, we trace changes of ornament and extract the underlying geometrical structure; we also use symmetry groups, the seven frieze groups and the seventeen wallpaper groups, in order to arrive at a deeper understanding of practical geometry in Sassanid stucco ornament. These analyses will evince features of Sassanid stucco ornament such as: motifs as part of the whole; rotational symmetry and repetition of motifs in linear networks; application of complicated geometrical structures with rotational or reflection symmetry; the planning of whole decorative panels. Also, analyzing the Sassanid stucco panels allows us to discover their repetitive units, which are then classified according to frieze and wallpaper groups.",

		"abstract": "For centuries, scientists have struggled to understand the origins of the patterns and forms found in nature. Now, in this lucid and accessibly written book, Philip Ball applies state-of-the-art scientific understanding from the fields of biology, chemistry, geology, physics, and mathematics to these ancient mysteries, revealing how nature's seemingly complex patterns originate in simple physical laws. Tracing the history of scientific thought about natural patterns, Ball shows how common presumptions–for example, that complex form must be guided by some intelligence or that form always follows function–are erroneous and continue to mislead scientists today. He investigates specific patterns in depth, revealing that these designs are self-organized and that simple, local interactions between component parts produce motifs like spots, stripes, branches, and honeycombs. In the process, he examines the mysterious phenomenon of symmetry and why it appears–and breaks–in similar ways in different systems. Finally, he attempts to answer this profound question: why are some patterns universal? Illustrations throughout the text, many in full color, beautifully illuminate Ball's ideas.",

In it, I share my own complicated experiences in CS, and relate them to those of others who we often describe as in dominant groups, trying to surface their unique forms of marginalization. I argue that CS is a refuge for dominant groups, show how that refuge is defined by social segregation, and then complicate broadening participation efforts by showing how uprooting that culture of segregation poses psychological and intellectual threats to dominant groups who are marginalized in their own ways.\n\nHere is the abstract for the talk:\n\nModern computing culture is unquestionably exclusionary. In education, students who are Black, Hispanic, women, women, gender non-conforming, disabled, or divergent in many other way from the dominant groups in computing often face structural barriers, microaggressions, and disregard. And in industry, these same problems perpetuate, not only shaping the culture of computing companies, but also their products, services, policies, and politics. The question is no longer whether exclusion occurs, but why. Many powerful explanations of these dynamics look to white supremacy, sexism, ableism, and capitalism, linking computing culture to the broader matrix of domination in society. In this talk, however, I want to consider an additional factor at play: the central role of social segregation in computing culture and how such segregation offers psychological safety to its dominant groups, who are in some ways marginalized themselves in society more broadly. By deconstructing these dynamics, and demonstrating how they interact with other systems of oppression to produce marginalization, I hope to map the significant challenges we face in reimagining a computing culture that is truly inclusive.",

In addition to cultural analysis of computing, it also utilizes computing to model artifacts or practices from a given culture. In this essay, we consider three modes of modeling. In the first mode, the knowledge flow is unidirectional: the researcher analyzes indigenous designs and provides a computing model. In the second mode, the knowledge flow is bidirectional with researchers bringing a technical etic (outsider) perspective and informants bringing a cultural emic (insider) perspective. In the third mode, knowledge flow is recursive; there are bidirectional flows nested within other bidirectional flows. Our case study begins with computer simulations of log curves in Adinkra symbols in Ghana. Thus, we show that there are nested flows between nature and the indigenous artisans who model nature’s growth patterns; between our own ethnocomputing simulations and the students and teachers in Ghanaian classrooms; and finally between the history of computing in the West and the implementation of educational technology. Our data indicates that a recursive model that can account for these nested flows better enables researchers to integrate social justice and sustainability with education and research in both social and technical domains.

Examples include simplifying workflow, producing relatively cheap short runs, or allowing designers to work with photographic imagery and unlimited colour palettes. This paper firstly identifies that digital fabric printing has a fundamentally different possibility in relation to its forerunners. Formerly, printing was essentially the ability to reproduce the same image (or text) over and over again. Digital printing, however, does not have to work from static information; it can print a design that changes as it is being printed.",

Our goal is to \"recycle\" users' otherwise-unused gesture variation to create rich output under the users' control, without sacrificing accuracy. Experiment 1 reveals a high level of existing gesture variation, even for accurate text, and shows that users can consciously vary their gestures under different conditions. We designed an Expressive Keyboard for a smart phone which maps input gesture features identified in Experiment 1 to a continuous output parameter space, i.e. RGB color. Experiment 2 shows that users can consciously modify their gestures, while retaining accuracy, to generate specific colors as they gesture-type. Users are more successful when they focus on output characteristics (such as red) rather than input characteristics (such as curviness). We designed an app with a dynamic font engine that continuously interpolates between several typefaces, as well as controlling weight and random variation. Experiment 3 shows that, in the context of a more ecologically-valid conversation task, users enjoy generating multiple forms of rich output. We conclude with suggestions for how the Expressive Keyboard approach can enhance a wide variety of gesture recognition applications.",

The key ideas in Fran are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are sets of arbitrarily complex conditions, carrying possibly rich information. Most traditional values can be treated as behaviors, and when images are thus treated, they become animations. Although these notions are captured as data types rather than a programming language, we provide them with a denotational semantics, including a proper treatment of real time, to guide reasoning and implementation. A method to effectively and efficiently perform event detection using interval analysis is also described, which relies on the partial information structure on the domain of event times. Fran has been implemented in Hugs, yielding surprisingly good performance for an interpreter-based system. Several examples are given, including the ability to describe physical phenomena involving gravity, springs, velocity, acceleration, etc. using ordinary differential equations.",

First, the writing of musical patterns in live coding performance, and second, the weaving of patterns in textiles. In both cases, algorithmic pattern is an interface between the human and the outcome, where small changes have far-reaching impact on the results. By bringing contemporary live coding and ancient textile approaches together, we reach a common view of pattern as algorithmic movement (e.g. looping, shifting, reflecting, interfering) in the making of things. This works beyond the usual definition of pattern used in musical interfaces, of mere repeating sequences. We conclude by considering the place of algorithmic pattern in a wider activity of making.",

		"abstract": "This chapter examines a performance devised and developed collaboratively by the authors between 2007 -11 which uses a repetitious, machine-inspired nineteenth-century dance to control a digital arts piece, exploring the performative interface between human machine workers and technology. The performance was awarded a Quake contemporary dance festival award in 2008. The dance, the The Machinery, traceable to the1820s, is striking as possibly the earliest example of the creative expression of alienation and dehumanization in the industrial workspace. Nineteenth-century cotton mill workers surrendered to the pace of the machine through necessity; in The Machinery, workers find a means of expression by coalescing with the machine, rather than escaping it, reflecting De Certeau's theories of ?the everyday?. A means of addressing boredom and repetition, the predominantly female workers responded performatively to the otherwise potentially overpowering and isolating noises and actions of ?the uniform and unceasing motion of the automaton? (Marx). The dance can be viewed as a way of maintaining the body's control, interaction and creativity, rather than allowing the body to become solely an extension of the capitalist means of production. Paralleling the working conditions of the nineteenth-century textile workers with those of today's computer operators, Radcliffe and Angliss created a mixed media performance piece inspired by women's interaction with technology. Taking the steps of the early nineteenth-century clog dance, they re-contextualised its history, using it to control a machine of the twenty-first century, the digital computer. Thus, the performers - dancer and computer operator - work together to create an intermedial space where the real world, occupied by the human worker, and virtual world of the machine are coupled to each other and acting in equal partnership. The extreme, machine-like control, virtuosity and physical endurance of the dance reflect the stamina required to survive repetitive labour in both the industrial and the post-industrial workplace.",

		"abstract": "Seeking new forms of expression in computer music, a small number of laptop composers are braving the challenges of coding music on the fly. Not content to submit meekly to the rigid interfaces of performance software like Ableton Live or Reason, they work with programming languages, building their own custom software, tweaking or writing the programs themselves as they perform. Often this activity takes place within some established language for computer music like SuperCollider, but there is no reason to stop errant minds pursuing their innovations in general scripting languages like Perl. This paper presents an introduction to the field of live coding, of real-time scripting during laptop music performance, and the improvisatory power and risks involved. We look at two test cases, the command-line music of slub utilising, amongst a grab-bag of technologies, Perl and REALbasic, and Julian Rohrhuber's Just In Time library for SuperCollider. We try to give a flavour of an exciting but hazardous world at the forefront of live laptop performance.",

		"abstract": "The philosopher Daniel Dennett argues that complex structures in the natural and cultural worlds emerge from two types of design. Bottom-up design involves the rote action of a simple algorithm in an environment constrained by physical laws. Top-down design involves deliberation and planning, and is unique to modern humans. Identifying the emergence of top-down design in the hominin lineage is an important research challenge, and the archaeological record of stone technology is our best evidence for it. A current view is that artefact types and flaking methods increased in complexity from 3.3 to c. 0.3 million years ago, reflecting improving capacities at spatial cognition and working memory, culminating in top-down design perhaps as early as 1.75 million years ago. Recent experimental work, however, has shown that a simple ‘remove flake’ algorithm constrained by the laws of fracture mechanics—a form of bottom-up design—can produce stone tool attributes thought to be evidence of top-down design. Here, these models are reviewed and critiqued in light of the new experimental evidence. A revised working memory-based model, focusing on the recursive aspects of stone flaking, is proposed.",

		"abstract": "What does an ancient weaver know, when she knows how to weave? How is this complex knowledge graspable and representable? The article presents the research practice of the PENELOPE project as it sets to explore the distinctive logic and order of ancient weaving − an inferential dimension embedded in the material and thus mainly implicit, which is best grasped through performing and which we address here as microperformative. In archaic Greek literary and philosophical sources, weaving is cast as a technology capable of imposing order, creating complex structure, and providing a model for cosmic generation. This pre-scientific ‘knowledge through order’ that weaving affords is in turn embedded in a performance culture where notions like kosmos and poikilia refer to woven fabrics, performances of song-and-dance, patterns in nature and in craft. The production of textile patterns incorporates the organization of elements into wholes in a way that is logical and algorithmic yet still unsuited to be laid down in writing. The mode of knowing specific to weaving is a liminal notion at the intersection of technology, knowledge, and embodied practice. Labelling this mode of ordering as microperformativity, one implication is that reflective decision-making, non-propositional knowledge and material agency all have a bearing on how in weaving threads perform together with the algorithm employed by the weaver, who needs to make decisions on repeats and recursion to generate a coherent whole. Using self-made technology, we then attempt to convey through performances the elements included as separate acts in weaving on the warp-weighted loom of antiquity. The order and patterns of weaving circulate through a multimodal and multimedial performance where the rhythms of ancient Greek poetry, manipulated as musical pattern by the live coder, govern the choreography of a set of synchronized arachnoid robots plaiting a braid by dancing around a maypole.",

On the other, Machine Learning (ML) systems that claim to predict human behaviour are becoming ubiquitous in all spheres of social life. I contend that ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML systems are close descendants of the Cartesian and Newtonian worldview in so far as they are tools that fundamentally sort, categorize, and classify the world, and forecast the future. Through the practice of clustering, sorting, and predicting human behaviour and action, these systems impose order, equilibrium, and stability to the active, fluid, messy, and unpredictable nature of human behaviour and the social world at large. Grounded in complexity science and enactive and embodied cognitive science approaches, this article emphasizes why people, embedded in social systems, are indeterminable and unpredictable. When ML systems “pick up” patterns and clusters, this often amounts to identifying historically and socially held norms, conventions, and stereotypes. Machine prediction of social behaviour, I argue, is not only erroneous but also presents real harm to those at the margins of society.",

The role of pattern in uniting dance, music and language is investigated in the ancient practice of weaving, in ancient Greek choral lyric, and contemporary live coding. In this context the TidalCycles environment is introduced, with some visual and audio examples. Cyclic metrical patterns in ancient Greek are then explored in detail, particularly the metrical transformations of Epiplokē. Finally, this jump between contemporary and ancient practice leads us to consider algorave itself as a Luddite movement, its proponents engaged in an unravelling of technology.",

		"abstract": "This paper reports on two generative systems that work in the domain of textiles: the Hoopla system that generates patterns for embroidery samplers, and the Foundry system that creates foundation paper piecing patterns for quilts. Generated patterns are enacted and interpreted by the human who stitches the ﬁnal product, following a long and laborious, yet entertaining and leisurely, process of stitching and sewing. The blending of digital and physical spaces, the tension between machine and human authorship, and the juxtaposition of stereotypically masculine computing with highly feminine textile crafts, leads to the opportunity for new kinds of tools, experiences, and artworks. This paper argues for the values of textiles as a domain for generative methods research, and discusses generalizable research problems that are highlighted through operating in this new domain.",

The Tacit Dimension argues that tacit knowledge—tradition, inherited practices, implied values, and prejudgments—is a crucial part of scientific knowledge. Back in print for a new generation of students and scholars, this volume challenges the assumption that skepticism, rather than established belief, lies at the heart of scientific discovery. “Polanyi’s work deserves serious attention. . . . [This is a] compact presentation of some of the essentials of his thought.”—Review of Metaphysics “Polanyi’s work is still relevant today and a closer examination of this theory that all knowledge has personal and tacit elements . . . can be used to support and refute a variety of widely held approaches to knowledge management.”—Electronic Journal of Knowledge \"The reissuing of this remarkable book give us a new opportunity to see how far-reaching—and foundational—Michael Polanyi's ideas are, on some of the age-old questions in philosophy.\"—Amartya Sen, from the new Foreword",

Previous research has tended to neglect the vital role of sources of inspiration in triggering and guiding designers’ activities. This paper reports research which investigates the gathering of inspiration sources and exploration of ideas and hence attempts to understand how inspiration is harnessed. We conducted a progressive series of empirical studies looking at knitwear design: in situ observation; semi-structured interviews; constrained design tasks; and computational modelling. The paper proposes simple general accounts of observed design behaviour and shows how a simple parts-and-relations account can explicate aspects of subtlety and complexity in design.",

Building on advances in anthropological ideologies away from white cultural and intellectual supremacy, ethnomathematics acknowledges that mathematics is pervasive in everyone’s life and community, in terms of construction, trade, craftsmanship, and so on, practices that are historically, socially, and culturally embedded. Such activities rarely if ever involve the solution of quadratic equations, or computations such as 3/7 + 5/9, disembodied exercises that are so prominent in school mathematics, which thereby often alienates students. The needs of society for a cadre of people skilled in academic mathematics and its applications does not justify the collateral damage done by school mathematics in terms of unnecessarily cutting off educational and financial opportunities, and damage to intellectual and cultural identities. It does not have to be like that.",

		"abstract": "Fractals are characterized by the repetition of similar patterns at ever-diminishing scales. Fractal geometry has emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers on the border between mathematics and information technology and can be seen in many of the swirling patterns produced by computer graphics. It has become a new tool for modeling in biology, geology, and other natural sciences. Anthropologists have observed that the patterns produced in different cultures can be characterized by specific design themes. In Europe and America, we often see cities laid out in a grid pattern of straight streets and right-angle corners. In contrast, traditional African settlements tend to use fractal structures-circles of circles of circular dwellings, rectangular walls enclosing ever-smaller rectangles, and streets in which broad avenues branch down to tiny footpaths with striking geometric repetition. These indigenous fractals are not limited to architecture; their recursive patterns echo throughout many disparate African designs and knowledge systems. Drawing on interviews with African designers, artists, and scientists, Ron Eglash investigates fractals in African architecture, traditional hairstyling, textiles, sculpture, painting, carving, metalwork, religion, games, practical craft, quantitative techniques, and symbolic systems. He also examines the political and social implications of the existence of African fractal geometry. His book makes a unique contribution to the study of mathematics, African culture, anthropology, and computer simulations.",

		"abstract": "This is the companion volume to the authors' groundbreaking Symmetries of Culture, the classic reference for symmetry analysis of pattern for anthropologists, archaeologists, art historians, mathematicians, and designers. Central to symmetry analysis is the use of symmetry in the more precise sense of its geometrical isometries in contrast to its everyday meaning of balance. For this volume, Donald Crowe and Dorothy Washburn invited colleagues from several disciplines to apply the method of symmetry analysis to actual case studies from cultures around the world.The essays compiled here explore how cultural information is embedded in the symmetrical structure of pattern. From descriptions of patterns on objects as diverse as Nasca embroideries, Ica Valley ceramics, Quechua textiles, Yombe mats, and Zulu beadwork, as well as from Amazonian shamanic therapy, ceramic design among the Shipibo, and Turkish Yörük weaving, the contributors reveal how the symmetrical structures in the patterns describe aspects of each culture's fundamental principles for living in the world. This approach offers a profoundly fresh way to read the meaning in pattern by arguing that pattern communicates through the structural metaphorsembedded in the symmetrical relationship of the pattern parts. The two volumes together offer readers a revolutionary new window into the communicative importance of design.",

Placed firmly in a social and historical context, it shows that Shamanism, considered superstition by many today, is alive and well in Seoul in a rich tradition reaching back to the Chosôn Dynasty (1392-1910), the capital of which was Hanyang (now Seoul). The instruments, dress and other accoutrements of courtly life from the Chosôn Dynasty have been taken up, although transformed, in contemporary rituals among spirit-possessed Shamans. Through a comparison of Hanyang kut - the rituals of the Hanyang Shamans - and the ritual practice of Inner Asian Shamans, and through an analysis of the relations of spirit-possession music rituals to musok, the indigenous religion of Korea, Seo sheds light on the role of music, spiritual practice and culture in present-day Korea.",

		"abstract": "The classic book on the art and history of weaving—now expanded and in full colorWritten by one of the twentieth century’s leading textile artists, this splendidly illustrated book is a luminous meditation on the art of weaving, its history, its tools and techniques, and its implications for modern design. First published in 1965, On Weaving bridges the transition between handcraft and the machine-made, highlighting the essential importance of material awareness and the creative leaps that can occur when design problems are tackled by hand.With her focus on materials and handlooms, Anni Albers discusses how technology and mass production place limits on creativity and problem solving, and makes the case for a renewed embrace of human ingenuity that is particularly important today. Her lucid and engaging prose is illustrated with a wealth of rare and extraordinary images showing the history of the medium, from hand-drawn diagrams and close-ups of pre-Columbian textiles to material studies with corn, paper, and the typewriter, as well as illuminating examples of her own work.Now available for a new generation of readers, this expanded edition of On Weaving updates the book’s original black-and-white illustrations with full-color photos, and features an afterword by Nicholas Fox Weber and essays by Manuel Cirauqui and T’ai Smith that shed critical light on Albers and her career.",

		"abstract": "In the 19th century, English textile workers responded to the introduction of new tecnologies on the factory floor by smashing them to bits. For years 'the Luddites' roamed the English countryside, practicing drills and maneuvers that they would later deploy on unassuming machines. The movement has been derided by scholars as a backwards-looking and ultimately ineffectual effort to stem the march of history; for Gavin Mueller, the movement gets at the heart of of the antagonistic relationship between workers - all workers, including us today - and the so-called progressive gains secured by new technologies. The luddites weren't primitive or even anachronistic - they are still a force, however unconsciously, in the workplaces of the 21st century world. Breaking Things at Work is an innovative rethinking of labor and machines, leaping from textile mills to algorithms, from existentially threatened knife cutters of rural Germany to surveillance evading truckers driving across the continental United States. Mueller argues that the future stability and empowerment of working class movements will depend on subverting these technologies and preventing their spread wherever possible. The task is high, but the seeds of this resistance are already present in the Neo-Luddite efforts of hackers, pirates, and dark web users who are challenging surveillance and control, often through older systems of communication technology.",

Rather than approaching co-presence and repetitive labor as a negative aspect of design, we look to current practices in procedural generation (most commonly used in game design and screen-based new media art) to understand how designers can create room for suprise and emergent phenomena within systems of precision and constraint. We developed three designs for blending real-time input with predetermined pattern features. These include: using camera imagery sampled at weaving time; a 1:1 scale tool for composing patterns on the loom; and a live \"Twitch” stream where spectators determine the woven pattern. We discuss how experiential qualities of the systems led to different balances of underdetermination in procedural generation as well as how such an approach might help us think beyond an artifact/experience dichotomy in fabrication.",

Papert argues that children are more than capable of mastering computers, and that teaching computational processes like de-bugging in the classroom can change the way we learn everything else. He also shows that schools saturated with technology can actually improve socialization and interaction among students and between students and teachers.Technology changes every day, but the basic ways that computers can help us learn remain.

		"abstract": "Our brain is a muscle. Like our bodies, it needs exercise. In the last few hundred years, we have stopped training our memories and we have lost the ability to memorise large amounts of information. Memory Craft introduces the best memory techniques humans have ever devised, from ancient times and the Middle Ages, to methods used by today's memory athletes. Lynne Kelly has tested all these methods in experiments which demonstrate the extraordinary capacity of our brains at any age. For anyone who needs to memorise a speech or a play script, learn anatomy or a foreign language, or prepare for an exam, Memory Craft is a fabulous toolkit. It offers proven techniques for teachers to help their students learn more effectively. There are also simple strategies for anyone who has trouble remembering names or dates, and for older people who want to keep their minds agile. Above all, memorising things can be playful, creative and great fun.",

Pat Treusch not only shows how both the fields of technofeminism and robotics can engage in a practical exchange through knitting, but also contributes a tangible example of coboting dynamics. Robotic Knitting re-negotiates the boundaries between formalization and embodiment, craft and high-tech as well as useful and dysfunctional machines. It re-crafts the nature of collaboration between human and robot. This finally entails an alternative mode of relating – a mode that enables an account of careful coboting.",

		"abstract": "The TidalCycles (or Tidal for short) live coding environment has been developed since around 2009, via several rewrites of its core representation. Rather than having fixed goals, this development has been guided by use, motivated by the open aim to make music. This development process can be seen as a long-form improvisation, with insights into the nature of Tidal gained through the process of writing it, feeding back to guide the next steps of development. This brings the worrying thought that key insights will have been missed along this development journey, that would otherwise have lead to very different software. Indeed participants at beginners’ workshops that I have lead or co-lead have often asked questions without good answers, because they made deficiencies or missing features in the software clear. It is well known that a beginner’s mind is able to see much that an expert has become blind to. Running workshops are an excellent way to find new development ideas, but the present paper explores a different technique - the rewrite.",

What unifies the chapters in this book can appear rather banal, but many mathematical insights are so obvious and so fundamental that they are difficult to absorb, appreciate, and express with fresh clarity. Some of the more basic insights are isolated by accounts of investigators who have earned their contemporaries' respect. Winner of the 2012 Cecil B. Currey Book Award.",

Suitable for geometry courses as well as independent study, this inspiring book is geared toward students, professional mathematicians, and readers interested in patterns and shapes artists, architects, and crystallographers, among others. Along with helpful examples from mathematics and geometry, it draws upon models from fields as diverse as crystallography, virology, art, philosophy, and quilting. The self-contained chapters need not be read in sequence, and each concludes with an excellent selection of notes and references. The first seven chapters can be used as a classroom text, and the final four contain fascinating browsing material, including detailed surveys of color patterns, groups of color symmetry, and tilings by polygons.",

		"abstract": "This position paper on Indigenous Protocol (IP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a starting place for those who want to design and create AI from an ethical position that centers Indigenous concerns. Each Indigenous community will have its own particular approach to the questions we raise in what follows. What we have written here is not a substitute for establishing and maintaining relationships of reciprocal care and support with specific Indigenous communities. Rather, this document offers a range of ideas to take into consideration when entering into conversations which prioritize Indigenous perspectives in the development of artificial intelligence. It captures multiple layers of a discussion that happened over 20 months, across 20 time zones, during two workshops, and between Indigenous people (and a few non-Indigenous folks) from diverse communities in Aotearoa, Australia, North America, and the Pacific.  \n\nIndigenous ways of knowing are rooted in distinct, sovereign territories across the planet. These extremely diverse landscapes and histories have influenced different communities and their discrete cultural protocols over time. A single ‘Indigenous perspective’ does not exist, as epistemologies are motivated and shaped by the grounding of specific communities in particular territories. Historically, scholarly traditions that homogenize diverse Indigenous cultural practices have resulted in ontological and epistemological violence, and a flattening of the rich texture and variability of Indigenous thought. Our aim is to articulate a multiplicity of Indigenous knowledge systems and technological practices that can and should be brought to bear on the ‘question of AI.’\n \nTo that end, rather than being a unified statement this position paper is a collection of heterogeneous texts that range from design guidelines to scholarly essays to artworks to descriptions of technology prototypes to poetry. We feel such a somewhat multivocal and unruly format more accurately reflects the fact that this conversation is very much in an incipient stage as well as keeps the reader aware of the range of viewpoints expressed in the workshops.",
